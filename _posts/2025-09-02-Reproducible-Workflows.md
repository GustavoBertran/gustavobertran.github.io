# What is reproducible science?

-   Reproducible science is the practice of conducting research in a way
    that allows others to **verify, replicate, and build upon the
    findings**. It involves documenting and sharing all aspects of the
    research process, including data collection, analysis, and
    interpretation.

# Types of reproducibility

-   **Methods Reproducibility**: refers to the provision of enough
    detail about study procedures and data so the same procedures could
    be exactly repeated with the same data
-   **Results Reproducibility** refers to obtaining the same results
    from the conduct of an independent study whose procedures are as
    closely matched to the original experiment as possible with
    independent data.

# Why is it important?

-   **Transparency**: Reproducible workflows enhance the transparency of
    research allowing others to understand how results were obtained.
-   **Verification**: They enable other researchers to verify findings,
    which is crucial for building trust in scientific results.
-   **Collaboration**; Reproducible workflows facilitate collaboration
    among researchers, as they can easily share and build upon each
    otherâ€™s work.
-   **Efficiency**: They save time and resources by allowing researchers
    to reuse code and data rather than starting from scratch.

# Key components of reproducible workflows

1.  **Version Control**: Using tools like Git to track changes in code
    and documents over time.
2.  **Documentation**: Providing clear and comprehensive documentation
    of the research process, including code comments and README files.
3.  **Data Management**: Organizing and storing data in a way that is
    accessible and understandable to others.
