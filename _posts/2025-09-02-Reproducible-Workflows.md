# What is reproducible science?

-   Reproducible science is the practice of conducting research in a way
    that allows others to **verify, replicate, and build upon the
    findings**. It involves documenting and sharing all aspects of the
    research process, including data collection, analysis, and
    interpretation.

# Types of reproducibility

-   **Methods Reproducibility**: refers to the provision of enough
    detail about study procedures and data so the same procedures could
    be exactly repeated with the same data
-   **Results Reproducibility** refers to obtaining the same results
    from the conduct of an independent study whose procedures are as
    closely matched to the original experiment as possible with
    independent data.

# Why is it important?

-   **Transparency**: Reproducible workflows enhance the transparency of
    research allowing others to understand how results were obtained.
-   **Verification**: They enable other researchers to verify findings,
    which is crucial for building trust in scientific results.
