# Welcome

My name is Gustavo Bertrán I am a Biology Master’s Student at the
University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez Campus. To be frank, my computer
knowledge is lacking, that is why I challenged myself to learn about
programming. Currently, I am learning about R Studio and Bash. So far
this is what I’ve been able to make so far (with a little help of
course). My goal is to be a profficient and talented coder so I can
analyze biological data while processing it too.
