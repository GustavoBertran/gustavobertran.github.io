# What is reproducible science?

-   Reproducible science is the practice of conducting research in a way that allows others to **verify, replicate, and build upon the findings**. It involves documenting and sharing all aspects of the research process, including data collection, analysis, and interpretation.

# Types of reproducibility

-   **Methods Reproducibility**: refers to the provision of enough detail about study procedures and data so the same procedures could be exactly repeated with the same data
-   **Results Reproducibility** refers to obtaining the same results from the conduct of an independent study whose procedures are as closely matched to the original experiment as possible with independent data.

# Why is it important?

-   **Transparency**: Reproducible workflows enhance the transparency of research allowing others to understand how results were obtained.
-   **Verification**: They enable other researchers to verify findings, which is crucial for building trust in scientific results.
-   **Collaboration**; Reproducible workflows facilitate collaboration among researchers, as they can easily share and build upon each other's work.
-   **Efficiency**: They save time and resources by allowing researchers to reuse code and data rather than starting from scratch.

# Key components of reproducible workflows

1.  **Version Control**: Using tools like Git to track changes in code and documents over time.
2.  **Documentation**: Providing clear and comprehensive documentation of the research process, including code comments and README files.
3.  **Data Management**: Organizing and storing data in a way that is accessible and understandable to others.
4.  **Automation**: Using scripts and tools to automate repetitive tasks, reducing the risk of human error.
5.  **Testing**: Implementing tests to ensure that code works as intended and produces consistent results.
6.  **Sharing**: Making code, data, and documentation publicly available through platforms like GitHub, Zenodo, or institutional repositories.

# README files
-  A **README file** is a text file that provides information about a project, including its purpose, how to use it, and an dependiencies or requirements.

# Basic structure of a README file
1.  Project Title: Brief and descriptive title of the project
2.  Description: Short summary of the project's purpose and goals
3.  Installation
4.  Usage
5.  License
